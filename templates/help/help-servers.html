   <br><strong>What is the XBMC Server?</strong><br><br>
    You should think of a XBMC Server as your HTPC where XBMC is installed. Your XBMC Library holds most of the information Maraschino requires to function correctly.<br>
	Maraschino allows mutliple Servers, but for the purposes of this help file, we'll assume you only have one.<br><br>
	
    The first thing you need to do is specify the address where XBMC is installed.<br>
	Follow step one on the first page by clicking the link -<br>
	<center><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/help/tutorial1.jpg') }}"></center><br><br>
    Then, fill in the details that correspond to your XBMC setup -<br>
	<center><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/help/tutorial2.jpg') }}"></center><br>
	These details can be found in XBMC under Settings > Services > Webserver.
    Username and Password is optional.<br>
	MAC Address is used for WOL (Wake-Up On LAN).<br>
	Position is the placement in the list, if you have more than one XBMC Server.<br><br>
    The click Save - You've successfully added a server.
